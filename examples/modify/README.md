Demonstrates how to modify requests. This is particularly useful for sending curved balls to your applications, and make sure they deal with them correctly. import hoverpy's main class: HoverPy 

```python
from hoverpy import HoverPy

```

Import requests for http 

```python
import requests

```

Create our HoverPy object with modify and middleware enabled. please note this brings in ```python examples/modify/modify_payload.py``` which will get run on every request 

```python
hoverpy = HoverPy(
    flags=[
        "-modify",
        "-middleware",
        "python examples/modify/modify_payload.py"])

```

Our middleware is designed to random return an empty body instead of what it's supposed to return (the curren time). This is a good example of how to alter your dependencies, and adequately test and react based on their content 

```python
for i in range(30):
    r = requests.get("http://time.jsontest.com")
    if "time" in r.json().keys():
        print(
            "response successfully modified, current date is " +
            r.json()["time"])
    else:
        print("something went wrong - deal with it gracefully")

```

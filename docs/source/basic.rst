This is by far the simplest example on how to get started with HoverPy. Let's import our most important class HoverPy, along with whatever else we may need 

::

>>> from hoverpy import HoverPy
>>> import requests


Now let's create our HoverPy object in capture mode. We do so with a `with` statement as this is the pythonic way, although this is not a necessity. 

::

>>> with HoverPy(capture=True) as hoverpy:


Print the json from our get request. Hoverpy acted as a proxy: it made the request on our behalf, captured it, and returned it to us. 

::

>>>     print(requests.get("http://ip.jsontest.com/myip").json())


Switch HoverPy to simulate mode. HoverPy no longer acts as a proxy; all it does from now on is replay the captured data. 

::

>>>     hoverpy.simulate()


Print the json from our get request. This time the data comes from the store. 

::

>>>     print(requests.get("http://ip.jsontest.com/myip").json())


Requests.db
-----------

You may have noticed this created a ``requests.db`` inside your current directory. This is a boltdb database, holding our requests, and their responses.

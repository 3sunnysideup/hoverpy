Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

HoverPy speeds up and simplifies tests that depend on HTTP / HTTPS
services. It does so by recording all HTTP traffic generated by your
python application inside a database file.

When you run your code again, it plays back the responses corresponding
to your requests. This means during the simulate phase, no HTTP traffic
gets generated whatsoever. This grants several benefits:

-  Increased test speed
-  Ability to work offline
-  Ability to modify traffic
-  Ability to simulate network latency
-  Deterministic test environment

If/when the service you are testing against changes its API, then you
can simply delete your db file, and capture the test results again.
HoverPy uses a `very high performance proxy written in
Go <http://hoverfly.io>`__, for this reason it is rock solid in terms of
speed and reliability.

Support

-  requests
-  urllib2

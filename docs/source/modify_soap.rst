modify soap
===========

In this example we'll take a look at using hoverpy in conjunction with middleware to modify SOAP data. This example builds upon the previous SOAP example, so I strongly suggest you do that one first.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/soap/soapModify.py
   :language: python

and here is our payload modification script:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/soap/modify_payload.py
   :language: python

===========

In this example we'll take a look at using hoverpy in conjunction with middleware to modify SOAP data. This example builds upon the previous SOAP example, so I strongly suggest you do that one first.

examples/soap/soapModify.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/soap/soapModify.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 7

Above, the only real difference with ``examples/soap/soap.py`` is that we're loading up HoverPy with middleware enabled.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/soap/soapModify.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 15

When running this script with ``python examples/soap/soapModify.py`` you should notice your city is 'New York'. That's the middleware modifying the result of our SOAP operation.

examples/soap/modify_payload.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And here are the important parts of our payload modification script.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/soap/modify_payload.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 7-8

Above we make sure we are importing the lxml classes that will help us modify the data.


.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/soap/modify_payload.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 19-21

Let's make sure we only operate when we have a response, and it has a body. 


.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/soap/modify_payload.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 22-29

We parse our xml and turn it into an object. Remember that our program gets our IP address, then tries to geo-locate us based on our IP. The intent of our middleware is to override the city no matter what.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/soap/modify_payload.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 31-34

We finally remove annotations and namespaces that got added to the City element by the objectify library, and serialise the modified body back into the response. And we are done.

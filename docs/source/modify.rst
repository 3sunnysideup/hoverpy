Import hoverpy's main class: HoverPy

.. code:: python

    from hoverpy import HoverPy

Import requests for http

.. code:: python

    import requests

Create our HoverPy object with modify and middleware enabled. please
note this brings in ``python examples/modify/modify_payload.py`` which
will get run on every request

.. code:: python

    hoverpy = HoverPy(
        flags=[
            "-modify",
            "-middleware",
            "python examples/modify/modify_payload.py"])

Our middleware is designed to random return an empty body instead of
what it's supposed to return (the curren time). This is a good example
of how to alter your dependencies, and adequately test and react based
on their content

.. code:: python

    for i in range(30):
        r = requests.get("http://time.jsontest.com")
        if "time" in r.json().keys():
            print(
                "response successfully modified, current date is " +
                r.json()["time"])
        else:
            print("something went wrong - deal with it gracefully")
